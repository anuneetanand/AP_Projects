## ArchLegends :shield:
A single-player role-playing game. The game is set in a time where a demon named Lionfang and his lieutenants have taken over the kingdom of Thunderforge. The purpose of the game is to allow the user to start as a hero and then defeat Lionfang. To reach LionFang the hero has to go through different locations where each location consists of a monster of a randomly assigned level.

```
Heroes : Warrior, Mage, Thief, Healer
Monsters : Goblins, Zombies, Fiends, Lionfang  
```
 
## Fibonacci :exclamation:
A producer-consumer based Fibonacci number calculator in Java by using explicit multithreading. Facade, Observer and Flyweight design patterns have been incorporated.

## Huffman ShannonFano :spiral_notepad:
Implemented Huffman and ShannonFano encoding for text compression. Observation: Huffman code offers less average access time and require less bits than Shannon-Fano code in most cases. For the sample input,
```
Generator.py : To generate random test cases
```

## Marathon :runner:
A Swing application to find winner of marathon.

## Mercury Store :shopping_cart:
A prototype of online store. The aim of the application is to connect merchants with customers and make the ensuing transaction hassle-free. OOP concepts like interfaces and polymorphism were incorporated while building the application.
